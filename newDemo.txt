1. short demo
new public class circle stop
  new public variable double radius stop
  new public method get circumference returns double stop
  new variable double pie equals three point one four stop
  if radius less zero stop
    return zero stop
    exit stop
  else stop
    return radius times pi times two stop

2. We have less than a minute of speech recognition at a time
- this is imposed by apple
- apple announced at the worldwide developer conferece in 2016 that they are open to making exceptions to this rule
- our app deals with this by showing a timer in the top right (remaining time)
- we have to pause at different times

3. Show multi-class program
new public class fish stop
  new public method swim returns void stop
    print quote the fish is swimming end quote stop
  new public method drink returns Integer stop
    while true stop
      return 5 stop
new public class square stop
  new private variable double size stop

4. Mention highlighting of active region, show goto

5. show sharing capabilities
- text
- email
- air drop
  - air drop to computer
  - show that it can be opened in text editor as a java file
